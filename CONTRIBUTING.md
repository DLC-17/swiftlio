## Guidelines
- Try to follow to the best of your ability the [Go Style Guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/index)
- Merges to master still allow anyone to do so (still wip) so be aware of merging to master. Make sure that every merge is accompanied by 
a reviewer and must be approved before being merged.
